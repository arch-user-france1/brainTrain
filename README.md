# brainTrain
A vocabulary trainer in python made because quizlet now costs.

There is no documentation yet but you can look into the code and find out yourself. 

# TODO
1. folders (being worked on)
2. machine learning
3. GUI
4. Documentation (I was working on it but GitHub only commited the half of the text so I removed it again :( )
